        <h1>Kayleigh and Nick's 2020</h1>
            <p>Well 2020 was a pretty crazy year wasn't it! Although we did
            have a few very dull months in total lockdown, we've been very
            fortunate to be in New Zealand where things were pretty
            normal for quite a lot of the year.</p>
            <p>We didn't get around to making our usual calendar this year,
            so instead here are a selection of photographs from things we've
            been getting up to. Sorry that there are so many... we found it
            hard to cut them down!</p>

        <h2>Home & Garden</h2>

        <p>Most (well, actually all) of the other photos are of various outdoor activities,
        but we do spend some time at home as well... we just don't take many
        pictures there! But here are a few of our house and garden.</p>

            George, but unfortunately George passed away, we think because we
            topped it up with chlorinated water.
            The lawn is a bit of a mess because it was dug up to lay a new
            drain over the winter. We've got some other work on the house
            coming up and it will all get tidied up after that.

        <h2>High Alpine Skills Course</h2>

        <p>In February Nick did a week long mountaineering course based at Plateau Hut underneath Mt Cook. 
            This involved practicing glacier travel, crevasse rescue,
            pitching on steep snow. We were super lucky to get a week of fine
            settled weather, almost unheard of in the New Zealand mountains,
            but it did mean that being on the glacier was like being in some
            kind of solar oven!
        </p>

        <h2>Mt Alexander</h2>

        Whilst Nick was on his high alpine skills course, Kayleigh joined a
        tramping club trip to climb mount Alexander, we had, rather
        ambitiously, tried to climb it a few years ago with a late start and
        in the snow. The route initially clibs to a hut in the forest on a
        fairly easy track and then becomes much steeper to the ridge, before
        a scramble to the summit.

        <h2>Mt Liverpool</h2>

        <p>In February, over the Waitangi weekend we headed down to the Aspiring
            National Park. We wanted to climb the highest peak in the area, Mt Aspiring / Tititea, but the
            weather wasn't quite good enough for that. Instead we climbed a lower peak
            called Mt. Liverpool (2482 m) instead. Check out the <a
            href="https://ctc.org.nz/db/index.php/routes/showRouteMapping/853/Mt%20Liverpool">route

        <h2>Philistine - Rolleston Traverse</h2>

        <p>Mt Rolleston (2275 m) is one of the highest mounatins in Arthur's
        Pass National Park (depending on where you believe the park boundaries lie), and
        its proximity to the road and reasonably good rock (for the area)
        make it a popular mountaineering destination. A popular route is to
        climb nearby Mt Philistine then traverse the ridge to Rolleston. The
        descent from Rolleston involves abseiling down the glacier, then
        traversing around to low peak before descending via the "Otira
        Slide", which in summer is a loose rock chute.
        </p>

        <p>We completed the trip in around 12 hours which is a respeoctable
        time, and beat Nick's previous personal best on the route by nearly 24 hours!</p>

        <h2>Remarkables Ice & Mixed Climbing Festival</h2>

        <p>In August we went to the <i>Remarkables Ice & Mixed Climbing
        Festival</i>, which is a long weekend where some of New Zealands top
        climbers and mountaineers volunteer to run courses for less
        experience people to raise money to fund mountaineering expeditions.
        It's held in The Remarkables, a mountain range just outside Queentown.
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately New Zealand went back to Covid Alert Level 2 just
        before the festival which meant some of the social actitivies were
        curtailed, but luckily the courses were still able to run. Nick did a
        course where day one was Ice Climbing and day two was Mixed Climbing,
        and Kayleigh did a course called "Chicks with Picks", which is a
        similar thing but taught by and aimed at women. Unfortunately
        Kayleigh took a bit of a fall and stabbed her leg with her crampon...
        but didn't realise until a couple of hours later having walked back
        to the capark quite how bad it was and had to got to A & E to have it
        stitched up. She missed the second day of the course, but was back in
        action the day after which got her a lot of credit with the hard climbers!

        <h2>Fiordland</h2>
        <p>After our time in Remarkables we had the rest of the week off.
        Since we were down South anyway we took the opporunity to go to
        Fiordland which is usually a very very long long drive from
        Christchurch. We had wanted to do some mountaineering routes but
        the weather wasn't really up to it. We did attempt the Phearson -
        McTalbot traverse, a classic Fiordland winter route, but the rock was
        still wet and we weren't keen on scrambling on loose rock with a
        thousand metre drop on each side! Our mountaineering ambitions dashed
        we did some easier walking and enjoyed the views and the solitude of
        the Alpine Club hut instead.

        <h2>Sea Kayaking in the Marlborough Sounds</h2>
        <p>For Labour weekend we decided to do something a bit different, and
        headed North to the Marlborough Sounds to do some sea kayaking. We've
        had basic sea kayaks for a while but before this trip had only done
        short day trips in them. We started from Havelock and paddled about
        20 km up Pelorous sound to a beautfiul campsite on Putanui point
        which is only accessable by boat. Then the next day we paddled back
        down the other side of the sound. It was a bit windier than expected,
        which made for some quite exciting moments in our small boats, but
        all in all a brilliant trip that encouraged us to upgrade our kayaks
        to something a bit more serious.</p>

        <p>One good thing about the South Island is that although the weather
        can be pretty variable, there's almost somewhere close enough to
        Christchurch for a weekend trip where the weather's good. One weekend
        in December it was raining heavily in the big mounatins, but we found
        a patch of nice weather slightly closer to home in the Torlesse range
        with a visit to Broken River Hut. Our aim was to get fit for a big
        trip in the summer, so we carried in some firewood to the hut - and a
        bottle of wine.

        <h2>North Island Christmas Holiday</h2>
        <p>We had planned to spend Christmas 2020 with Kayleigh's parents who
        were due to visit, but for obvious reasons that didn't happen.
        Instead we'd planned a fairly epic 10 day trip to an Ice Plateau in a
        wilderness area in the South Island... but the weather forecast for
        the South Island for our two week Christmas break was terrible, so we
        decided to go to the North Island instead with our friend Eric. We
        planned to visit the glaciers on Mt Ruapehu which is and active
        volcano, but just before getting on the plane we found out the
        volcanic alert level for Ruapehu had been raised to level 2, the most
        serious before an actual eruption! This meant we couldn't go within
        two kilometeres of the crater lake, which had increased in
        temperature to 40&#176;C.
        </p>
        <p>Despite not being able to visit the crater, we were still able to do the "Round the Mountain" route, a 66 km tramp around Ruapehu. 
            We somewhat ambitiously did this in two and a half days which was
            a bit hard on our feet and knees! The track stays between about
            1200 m and 1500 m altitude the whole way round, but despite this
            there is an awful lot of ups and downs crossing deep valleys
            scoured by "Lahar" - mudflows - from prvious eruptions. The
            scenary was really varied from bush on the West side to New
            Zealand's only true desert landscape on the East.

        <p>After completing the Round The Mountain tramp we headed up to the
        New Zealand Alpine Club hut on Ruapehu ski-field. Despite being an
        hour and a half walk from the road end this hut has electricity and a
        decent kitchen so was a good place to spend Christmas. Christmas Day
        was about the only warm and sunny day of the holiday. We took
        advantage of the weather to traverse Pinnacle Ridge. The guidebook
        described this as "one of the best alpine adventures in the North
        Island" and said "the rock is generally sound". To be honest the rock
        was pretty loose and scary, but it was a good day out anyway.</p>
